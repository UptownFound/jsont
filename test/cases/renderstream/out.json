In the Guard &#39;s bearskin hat are four chicks and on the baton sits a bird with a worm for his chicks.\r\n\r\nIB Antoni did not have a family in his too-short life but IB was very fond of his brother George and his family. The two worked closely together on advertising designs for many years.  Here George&#39;s family is represented by the papa bird and four baby chicks.\r\n\r\nThis tea towel is in excellent vintage condition as I am pretty sure it was purchased and put into a closet until I purchased it in an estate sale.  The colors are beautiful and vibrant.\r\n\r\nI have two of these in my shop...please look for the other as they are slightly different.\r\n\r\nMeasures 24&quot; by 15.&quot; Signed Antoni.",

The adapter ring is marked &quot;TIFFEN SERIES C ADAPTER RING DJ USA&quot;. Series C adapters used a letter code to designate the size that it fits on, so this is a size DJ.  I believe that this adapter ring has 20.5mm male threads on one end, and the other end has female Series C threads.  Made of aluminum.\r\n\r\nSee photo #3 for all major cameras that lens will work with.\r\n\r\nPlease visit my &quot;Vintage Photography&quot; section if you love old cameras!",

There were a number of talented artisans producing colorful and dramatic designs in the Southern California area. The 5 best known were Bauer, Pacific, Gladding-McBean, Vernon and Metlox. Smaller, lesser known companies included Batchelder, Catalina Island, Brayton Laguna, La Mirada, Meyers and Winfield just to name a few. Due to the topography of So.

        "Description": "Here are volumes Three, Seven, Nine, Fourteen, Sixteen and Twenty-One of Figure Quarterly Magazine.  They are all in Fair-to-Good Condition with some marks (see photo four) on some pages and they definitely were read and studied.  There are no missing pages that I can find and the bindings are intact though not in perfect shape (see photo five)\r\n\r\nThe two most well-known magazines are the Vargas and Picasso Editions.  Both completely intact and the extra Vargas (suitable for framing) art pieces and also still attached (see photo three).\r\n\r\nOverall I would say they are in fair-to-good  condition.  A great addition to anyone&#39;s photography or art collection.\r\n\r\nFor serious buyers I can take many more photos and send to you.  These magazines are very cool and still have great information!",

        "Description": "Here is the iconic Congo ice bucket designed by Jens Quistgaard for Dansk in 1961. It is exquisitely crafted of staved teak (kind of put together like a barrel) and has an orange liner. It is an early one--made in Denmark--and has the correct stamp on the bottom. Marked IHQ (Iens is the Danish spelling of Jens) and has the three ducks, and Made In Denmark.\r\n\r\nOverall is in excellent vintage condition, with no cracks in the staves, but some small areas of white paint? chalk? in the grain of the wood.  With some elbow grease and teak soap, it might just come out.  Orange liner is in great shape. Lid is present.\r\n\r\nThis piece measuresapprox:  19&quot; high and 9&quot; in diameter at it&#39;s widest point.",

There were a number of talented artisans producing colorful and dramatic designs in the Southern California area. The 5 best known were Bauer, Pacific, Gladding-McBean, Vernon and Metlox. Smaller, lesser known companies included Batchelder, Catalina Island, Brayton Laguna, La Mirada, Meyers and Winfield just to name a few. Due to the topography of So. Cal., there was no shortage of unique and interesting clay combinations. Mix that with the skill and vision of artisans / craftsmen, in a rapidly growing area, and countless potteries were formed. Today, pottery wares from California are becoming more, and more collectible.",

Circa 1959.  \r\n\r\nThe machine is in perfect condition, the box is a little torn but still in good condition.  Some tape holding the corners together.\r\n\r\nThe exerciser measures approx 24&quot; long.\r\n  \r\nSome fun information I found about the Whitely Exercise Co:\r\nThe Whitely name comes from Alex Whitely, who had published works on the subject of exercise, for men and women, dating to 1891 — and perhaps earlier. He is credited with inspiring Joseph Pilates, among others. The earliest Whitely Exercisers appear to have been manufactured by the Independent Electric Company, but a few years later products would be credited to the Whitely Exerciser Company.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, the Whitely Exerciser Company signed “the father of modern bodybuilding”, the big man who is the little body of the Mr. Olympia trophies, Eugen Sandow as their European agent. Sandow was to to represent the company and demonstrate the product abroad. It was a great success. Perhaps too much so. According to David L. Chapman in Sandow the Magnificent: Eugen Sandow and the Beginnings of Bodybuilding, Sandow did more than take the money and sell:  &quot;Sandow found that this device was so enthusiastically received that a year after he began work for Whitely he quit abruptly and established his own rival business in France. There he produced his particular version of the device and called it: Sandow’s Own Combined Developer.”",

The planter, without chain length, measures 26&quot;h x 11&quot;Dia.  The chain with the wood loop measures another 12&quot;.\r\n\r\n+++International buyers:  Shipping quote is only an estimate.  If you are interested in this item, you can msg me for a quote.  If you purchase, I will refund any overage or if not enough, I will need the difference to send package.  All depends on where you live - although my guess is it should not cost more than price quoted.",

Does not include lampshade.\r\n\r\nMetal top ring and base leaf metal are in excellent condition; glass is in excellent, undamaged condition, wiring is old but in excellent condition.\r\n\r\nc. 1940-1960. \r\n\r\nAcquired at an auction that featured fine antiques and art from a prominant Las Vegas art dealer and a prominant Las Vegas Antique dealer.  AMAZING PIECE!\r\n\r\nShipping will be slightly higher with this item as we will have it professionally packaged before being sent out due to the extremely delicate nature of the pieces.  Shipping is only a guesstimate.  Any major overages will be refunded.  Shipping to California will likely be cheaper, however, shipping to China may be more expensive.",

The color ranges from white to offwhite with some having very light speckles - all consistent with the finest laiki shell leis/necklaces.\r\n\r\nIt is easily recognizable as a VINTAGE Lei based on the &quot;Clasp&quot; as this was a popular closure in the 1950s and 1960s.  It was made by the native Ni&#39;ihau family as everything is consistent with all definitions.  \r\n\r\nWe purchased this piece on the Island of Maui in the locals city of Wailuku in a shop with many amazing estate finds.\r\n\r\nSome info about Laiki  shell leis:\r\n&quot;The Laiki shells (&quot;rice shells&quot;) tend to be white or yellow in hue and are have the same appearance as a grain of rice. These shells are pierced differently, from end to end, and can be found in the long single strands (Kui Pololei) favored by Hawai&#39;i&#39;s queens.
